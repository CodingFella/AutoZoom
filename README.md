# AutoZoom
Automatically joins your zoom meetings if you provide the time, day, and link. Useful for students with fixed schedules.

HOW TO USE:
First, extract it. Then, modify Schedule.txt to match your schedule. There are examples already provided. Be sure to follow the syntax given, otherwise the code might not work. Make sure your computer has set a default browser to something and allow the browser to automatically open the Zoom app when it launches the link.

HOW TO RUN:
Open Command Prompt or Terminal and type in the file location of Main.java and Schedule.txt. On Windows, you can type this: dir Downloads/AutoZoom-main/AutoZoom-main/src, and this will open up to the file. Then, type "javac Main.java" to compile the class. After a couple seconds, type "java Main.java" to run the program. It'll continue running as long as you don't close Command Prompt. If it says javac is not recognized as a command on Windows, "Select Start -> Computer -> System Properties -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables -> System Variables -> PATH" and make sure the path is set to the file location of Java. For example, my file location is "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_101\bin". The version may differ but it won't affect the code.
